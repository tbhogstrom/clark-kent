## What is a Kanban Board and Why Use One for Your Job Search?

For job seekers, a Kanban board offers several key benefits:

* **Improved Organization:**  Keep track of all your applications, interviews, and offers in one central location. No more frantic searching through emails or spreadsheets!
* **Enhanced Visibility:**  See precisely where each application is in the process and identify bottlenecks.
* **Reduced Stress:**  Knowing exactly what needs your attention helps minimize anxiety and keeps you focused.
* **Increased Productivity:**  A clear visual representation of your progress motivates you and helps you stay on track.
