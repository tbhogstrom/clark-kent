MaryJobins helps you organize your job search, and our Kanban board feature is the perfect way to keep track of your applications, interviews, and offers.

## What's a Kanban Board, and Why Should You Care?

A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that helps you track progress by moving "cards" (representing tasks) across different stages. Imagine a board with columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." You write your tasks on cards, move them through the columns as you complete them, and watch your progress unfold.

In the context of your job search, a Kanban board can be a game-changer.  It keeps everything organized, allowing you to focus on the next step without getting overwhelmed. This method significantly improves your chances of landing your dream job.
